# Etch-a-Sketch

A project to practice DOM manipulation.  The grids for the etch-a-sketch are dynamically added with JavaScript.  To change the default dimension, press the 'reset' button and enter a number when prompted.  This number (ex: 16) will now set the dimensions of the etch-a-sketch to 16x16 (or whichever number you input).  The size of each inidivdual grid will also change to keep the etch-a-sketch size consistent across any dimension. Try it out here -> https://hootdunk.github.io/etch-a-sketch/
